I'm not a poet, and it's difficult for me to write a 10-verse poem.

But luckily, this year is all about GenAI. I used GenAI to help me rewrite the poem [Jenn Bergstrom](https://dev.to/jennworks40) has written.

Using Step Functions to make a Christmas Tree reminds me of the grand old days of ASCII art. And here is the Step Functions Christmas Tree I've created.

2023 has been an adventurous year for me. I'm so thankful to the AWS Community Builders and those who make this program great.

This year, I've met many CBs on different occasions. The CB program makes me feel like I am part of the community; I know where I can find people to talk to and where I can participate.

Of course, being recognized as an AWS Security Hero is the biggest thing to me this year. Although it's just a month ago, it feels like time has passed a long way already.

Again, I'm so thankful to the people who have helped me, and pushed me along the way, Jason Dunn, Lily Kerns, Taylor Jacobsen, Johannes Koch, Chris Williams, ... _(No specific order)_

And, of course, thanks to the AWS community in Hong Kong, Amy Wong, Gabriel Koo, Anthony Lai. My fellow AWS Heroes from HK, Cyrus Wong, and Alex Lau. _(No specific order)_
